PART 1
1. Commits are nodes, users are represented using different colors & edges & a spatial separation of nodes. They are spaced out over time, with a chronology bar on the top. Other attributes that could be relevant include: code frequency (how is that different from commits? is that a measure of chronological denisty? as perhaps a bar graph on the bottom?); days of the week; any relationship between the users working on the repo. 
2. Yup. If you're working for a company, punchcard could be useful to show you're working everyday. The network graph is probably good for repos where you are working on a team so you know who worked on what and when (I guess that's also other info you could get, what part of the repo you made changes to?). You could show visitors what the repo actually does rather than the name; and you could show frequency of updates to users (esp if you can also record requests or questions?). Could also use data on how many other projects / repos the individual contributors have going on total to get an idea for bandwidth and overall prioritization / workflow.
3. Check that people are working, check that people are updating the code, that people are dedicated to such and how each repo links to other repos and what each does?
4. I want to design to include data on perhaps how many other projects the contributors are working on and their average commit activity and how that compares to their commit activity to this repo.
