1. filter and sort based on time/user/branch, etc. compute some sort of derived value by aggregating data across branches/time/user/etc. determine a range - of time, of branches, of contributors. characterize the distribution of contributions over these variables. see if there are clusters. perhaps correlate some of these (e.g. this user only commits to this branch). find extreme cases using these ranges. find nodes adjacent to a node. find number of nodes adjacent. nodes with maximum number of adjacent nodes. etc.
