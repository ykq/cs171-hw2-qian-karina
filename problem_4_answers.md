So I discussed with my design studio partner a way to separate users. And it turns out that in the GitHub data there is some separation, between the author and the committer. But there are still differences between casual committers, users, and major contributors who write a majority of the code. We talked about doing a radial network diagram that would show how people who contribute code relate to each other and who are the major contributors. Luckily, this builds off well the force-directed graph we built off of for the simple_graph. I changed the calculation of links to reflect relationships between code authors/committers (eliminating nodes for which there are no code authors, not sure what the distinction there is because they are often the same but otherwise I had 20K+ links and the graph was just overwhelmed). I also changed the calculation of the link distance to reflect the weight of the node - e.g. how many other nodes linked into it. This helps emphasize major code contributors, since they will pull others closer to them. I also minimized the level of commits pulled from the API because, especially for this repo which has <10 contributors (and actually even fewer because some are actually duplicates but somehow have different github accounts probably for different computers?) you can already show the network of contributor relationships with just a small sample of the code.
