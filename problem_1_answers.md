1. 
Contributors
	- audience: project manager who wants to see who is working and how frequently, contributors want to compare and see who else is working on what; users to see who is contributing to the repo, etc.
	- data: data on the name of the contributor and some of their profile info (#commits, #additions, #deletions, etc.), and aggregated numbers of all of the above over time with regard to this repo
	- lots of commits: just a huge spike in commits/additions/deletions for that time period reflected in the graph 
Commits
	- audience: project managers who want to see how often people are working and users to see how often repo updated, etc.
	- data: frequency of commits over roughly every week (bar graph) and over the week (line graph on bottom), get from stats api
	- lots of commits: huge spike in bar graph, line graph
Code Freq
	- audience: project managers who want to see how often people are working and users to see how often repo updated, etc.
	- data: frequency of additions/deletions over roughly every week (bar graph) and over the week (line graph on bottom), get from stats api
	- lots of commits: huge spike in graph
Punch card
	- audience: project managers who want to make sure people are working every day! and contributors who want to do the same? 
	- data: size of net contributions every day of the week organized by time of the day, can see when most people are working on it and possible collaborate better?
	- lots of commits: circle will get a lot bigger, may need to resize the rows accordingly
Pulse
	- audience: project managers who want to make sure issues are being addressed; users who want to raise issues and put in requests; and contributors who want to submit issues but also correct them
	- data: active, closed and new issues; commits by contributors; total data on authors, commits, files, etc. for the last week, pull requests, etc. snapshot of the last week and previous weeks if you scroll down.
	- lots of commits: bar graph on right will get higher, so may need to resize there and also update number of commits but other than that shouldn't be a problem.
Calendar
	- audience: project managers and contributors who want to make sure people are working all the time or see how often people are working, users who want to know how often repo updated
	- data: frequency and degree of activity per day, organized by day of the week and month. each square represents a day, and it is colored according to a gradient where darker equals more activity.
	- lots of commits: the square for that day will just get darker.
